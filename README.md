#### Test:
1. Tests to make sure that
    * the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.
2. Test that ensures that
    * the menu element is hidden by default and ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
3. Test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the  .feed container.
4. Test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
